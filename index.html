         <p>When we first start with <b>Glass/Metal</b> pipes these can be starting with you knowing how to grind, pack, and to take quarter/corner hits. Without this knowledge you could seriously be wasting some good stuff and relax vibes.</p>
         <p>Then when we get to <b>Blunts</b>. These are the most party heavy, and mainly if you have a social friend with you. Unless you can take a few hits and slowly burn and put out. But going through one in 10 mins is such a shame</p>
         <p>Now we have my favorite <b>Carts</b> in the play. These are the most [powerful] out of all ways to smoke. I learned this from the "Grow Bible" by Greg Green.</p>

         <h1>How to Smoke Basic</h1>
         <p>Here we want to go over the basic of how to smoke basic since we have covered the basics of what they are and most used and favor of the kind I have found in Louisville, Ky.</p>
         <div id="Codebasic">
         <code>Basic #1: We need to swallow, and or eat our smoke to a point that it stores to our stomach and lungs.</code>
         <p>With this in play, we will start to build up tolerance at the same time, so be aware that you may need to start smoking more, and or think you are using more, but don't worry we are teaching you to save.</p>
         <code>Basic #2: Also we need to learn how to hold in as long as we can until there is a point of cough, and you don't back down.</code>
         <p>This is vital, and very needed to break of out common habit if releasing after a few seconds, due to the THC and or compounds not having time to stay, or even attach to you.</p>
         <code>Basic #3: Less is best, so corners for pipes, take a hit of blunt and set it down and or pass instantly, and carts go for blinkers once every 15-30 mins if starting off.</code>
         </div>
         <p>This last basic is overall vital to make sure during this learning process you will have the abillity to manage, enchance, and value smoking in so many ways.</p>
         <p><b>Next</b> we are going to label them out in a neat codebox just for you to save, or snipping tool from windows computers, or screen capture to most other OS.</p>

         <h1>The Rules Of Smoking</h1>
         <p class="prules">Here we are going to put the rules in a nice neat box, and keep it simple with three rules only, and hopefully you share them with others.</p>
         <div id="codebox">
           <code>#1 - Make sure to "Eat" your smoke.</code>
           <br></br>
           <code>#2 - Take that hit, and hold it to the max of each thing. Hit = Max, Hold = Max</code>
           <br></br>
           <code>#3 - Less is Best</code>
           </div>
           <div class="rulelist">
           <ul class="ruleul">
             <li>Copy And Paste</li>
             <li>Or Screenshot</li>
           </ul>

         <header><b>How Can I Trust This</b></header>
          <div id="line"></div>
        <h1>How can I trust this</h1>
        <p>If you had that from the start, don't worry, we all have the same mindset, there is no way to really smoke better. But in reality, there is.</p>
        <p>I was someone that would go through a 1ml/1g cartridge in 1-2 days. And that's not even a full 1-2 days. So when I started to stop taking these little hits, and just hits that can barley hit the max, I started to think. "What If". These what if's were the best one's to have. I studied doing corners on pipes, and much study with real sitatuions from various people.</p>

         <h1>How to Start?</h1>
         <p>The best way to start, is what you are doing now, but try to not "anaylze", but to pay attention to how things make you feel. Is the level you are at now, too much. Because that is real. We can be taking too much and honestly not ever getting a peak, and because we never push barriers. Here's my last hidden rule that you should pass on.</p>
